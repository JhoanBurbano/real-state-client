# UX Guide

- Focus: all interactive elements show a 3px offset focus ring using semantic accent color.
- Motion: respect `prefers-reduced-motion`; avoid parallax and large-scale animations.
- Filters: debounced inputs, explicit labels, `aria-describedby` for range/number guidance.
- Grid: responsive 1–4 columns; use `next/image` with `sizes` to prevent CLS.
- Empty & Skeleton: show meaningful empty states and skeletons for perceived performance.
- Toasts: use for confirmations and failures; also mirror errors inline when possible.
- Gallery: keyboard navigation with visible focus; lightbox can be added with focus trap.
